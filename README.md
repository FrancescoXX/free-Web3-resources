## 🔮 Solana

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89864818/193443511-1a552e0f-199f-465d-a492-187aca0620bf.png)
Solana is a public blockchain platform with smart contract functionality. Its native cryptocurrency is SOL.
Solana achieves consensus using a proof-of-stake mechanism and its model, known as "proof-of-history" mechanism. Proof of history enables the network to operate faster because nodes do not need to communicate to validate a block. The Solana whitepaper describes this design as a decentralized clock.

## 🌊 Flow
![image](https://assets.website-files.com/5bf4437b68f8b29e67b7ebdc/605235166c5c86fb55388373_flow-blockchain-quantstamp.png)

Flow is one of the leading blockchains for the next generation of apps, NFTs, and games. It’s designed to scale in a way that doesn’t use sharding techniques, so transactions are fast and low-cost. Most notably, Flow is focused on reducing the complexity that is seen in other blockchains. Take, for example, purchasing a CryptoKitty. Behind the scenes, that process can involve dozens of blockchain transactions. But on Flow, the same action is handled by one atomic transaction in a single block.The Flow blockchain is designed not just to improve the end-user experience but also to allow developers to build, test, and launch projects quickly and sustainably.

## ⚡ Tezos 
![image](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20220331006098/en/1408296/5/TezosLogo_Horizontal_Black.jpg)

Tezos set out in 2014 to create what it called a “self-amending blockchain”. Complex in implementation, at its core, the concept was simple: Tezos would allow anyone who owned its XTZ cryptocurrency to vote on possible changes to its rules, and once decided, the software would automatically update to ensure the changes were made. 
By using this system, Tezos aimed to reduce the chances its blockchain might fork, creating two separate cryptocurrencies with two distinct prices.
