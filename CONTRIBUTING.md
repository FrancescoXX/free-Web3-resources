# Contributing Guidelines

🎉 **First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** 🎉

## 🤔 How can I contribute?

### 🛠 Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions. 🔎

Since GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you to include most information possible.

You can see **issues** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages 📝

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.
- Reference [issues](issues) and [pull requests](prs) liberally after the first line.
- Follow the [conventional commits](conventional-commits) guidelines

## How to Contribute 🚀

- Please create an [issue](issues) before creating a pull request.
- Fork the repository and create a branch for any issue that you are working on.
- Create a pull request which will be reviewed and suggestions would be provided.
- Add Screenshots to help us know what changes you have done.

## How to make a pull request 🤔

**1.** Fork [this](repo) repository.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/free-Web3-resources.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd free-Web3-resources
```

**4.** Create a new branch

Kindly give your branch a more descriptive name like `feat-add-ethereum` instead of `patch-1`.

You could follow this convention. Some ideas to get you started:

- Feature Updates: `feat-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- Bug Fixes: `fix-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- Documentation: `docs-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- And so on...

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

**5.** Add the resource, please follow the guidelines following

- Add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
  - Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Don't mention `Web3` in the description as it's implied.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove any trailing whitespace.

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**

**6.** Stage your changes and commit.

```bash
git add . # Stages all the changes
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

[**Follow our commit guide from above**](#style-guide-for-git-commit-messages-)

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

**8.** Create a new [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from `your-branch-name`

**9.** 🎉 Congratulations! You've made your first pull request! Now, you should just wait until the maintainers review your pull request.

## 🛑 Important

### ✅ Good Practice

- Comment on the issue to get assigned
- Create an issue before you make a Pull Request

### ❌ Bad Practice

- Creating PRs without assignment will not be accepted and will be closed.
